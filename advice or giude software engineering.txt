Laravel 8 includes several features for authentication and authorization out of the box. Some of the key features include:

Authentication Scaffolding: Laravel 8 provides a simple way to setup authentication by running the command php artisan make:auth which will create a default controller, views, and routes for handling authentication and authorization.

Guard: Laravel 8 uses guards to authenticate users. The default guard is set to web and you have to configure the guard to api in case you are working with API.

User Provider: Laravel 8 uses user providers to retrieve user records from your database or other storage systems. The default user provider uses the Eloquent ORM to retrieve user records from the users table.

Password Encryption: Laravel 8 uses the bcrypt algorithm to encrypt passwords. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your database, they will not be able to read the users' passwords.

Login Throttling: Laravel 8 includes login throttling to prevent brute-force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts from a specific IP address.

CSRF Protection: Laravel 8 includes built-in protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks by automatically generating and validating CSRF tokens on forms.

Authorization: Laravel 8 includes a simple way to authorize user actions by using gates and policies.

Remember me: Laravel 8 provides a simple way for users to remain logged in to the application between sessions by setting a remember me token.

Two-Factor Authentication: Laravel 8 support for two-factor authentication through the use of the google authenticator package
